This is a java project with two Classes EncryptFile and Decrypt file, and a class EncryptDecrypt which is used to encrypt/decrypt a string using AES algorithm with a user provided symmetric key. The EncryptFile class gets a file name, reads the file and encrypts the file using a user provided key, the file name and the result (base64) is stored in a file with extension .enc. The file is then accessed in the DecryptFile class, user is requested for file name, then key to decrypt, if decryption succeeds, the result is written back to a file with the file name and extension stored in the .enc file.
